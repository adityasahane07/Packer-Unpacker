# Packer-Unpacker

This project works in two different parts :- 
1. The first part of the project does file packing activity and second part of the project does unpacking activity.
2. This project accepts one folder from the user as a input and the packing activity of that project will combine all the contents of that folder into a single file.
3. That single file is called as a packed file.
4. In case of unpacking activity, our project accepts that packed file as input and it will generate all the files from that folder again. This activity is called as an Unpacking activity.
